# Goals
The long-term goal of this project is to give FTC teams a relatively streamlined interface to use neural networks for object detection during competitions. Broken down, this means my intention is to enable teams to:
* Transplant a pre-trained network into their robots which already detects game elements like robots and balls
* Create their own training data and train a custom neural net object detector
